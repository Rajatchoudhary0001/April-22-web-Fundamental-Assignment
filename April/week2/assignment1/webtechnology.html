    <h2>HTML</h2> 
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page
            HTML consists of a series of elements
            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
            </p>
        <p>The !DOCTYPE html declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
            The html element is the root element of an HTML page
            The head element contains meta information about the HTML page
            The title element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
            The body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            The h1 element defines a large heading
            The p element defines a paragraph
            </p>
        <p>Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

            However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
            
            We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
            
            Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

    <h2>CSS</h2> 
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
        </p>
    <p>CSS Solved a Big Problem
        HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
        
        HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
        
        h1-This is a heading.
        
        p-This is a paragraph.
        
        When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
        
        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
        
        CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
    
    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
        
        Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
        Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
        Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
        Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</p>
     <h2>Java script</h2><p>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

     <p>JavaScript Programs
        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
        
        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
        
        A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
        
        In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
        
        JavaScript Statements
        JavaScript statements are composed of:
        
        Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
        
        This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":</p>

     <h2>React js</h2><p>What is React?
        React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
        
        React is a tool for building UI components.
        
        How does React Work?
        React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
        
        Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
        
        React only changes what needs to be changed!
        
        React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
        
        You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.
